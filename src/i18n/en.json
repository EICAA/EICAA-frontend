Data download comes in csv-file format. It needs to be combined with the variable keys sheet (available for download next to the csv file) which provides all information on the full variable names (competence questions of self-assessment, demographics). Both files can be retrieved from the Competence Monitor area of the platform once you have finished an assessment.",
      "9": "Yes, it is. For more information please consult our privacy policy:  https://platform.eicaa.eu/user/privacy-policy",
      "10": "Either way is possible: Option 1 (separate self-assessments): You can create separate assessments for each faculty (but all in one user account). This may make it easier for you to tell them apart afterwards. Option 2 (one self-assessment for all): Splitting the data afterwards is possible indirectly as the demographic questions of the self-assessment ask e.g. for “area of studies”. Such info can be used to match groups of participants (e.g. students) then to the profile of the respective unit (e.g. faculty). However, this matching may not be so accurate and depends on whether participants make the right selection in the demographics part of the self-assessment survey. Also, the data splitting would need to take place outside the platform (download csv data file from the platform and import to statistical programme of your preference, split/segment data manually there). Ultimately, whether to take option 1 or 2 is also up to your goal of analysis. If data segmentation by organizational unit does not matter for you, we would recommend Option 2.",
      "11": "In principle, this is possible. However, you cannot directly compare different assessments inside the platform (data dashboard of Competence Monitor). You can only compile different assessments. Nevertheless, there is two ways how to compare data. 1. The data dashboard of the Competence Monitor does allow you to download the analytical charts for each assessment. In case you created separate assessments for each organizational unit, you can download the data charts and compare them manually (outside the platform) 2. You can always download your assessment data as csv file. If you then import the csv file into a statistical programme (e.g. SPSS), you can also analyze the data yourself. Of course, you could also manually merge two different csv files (two different assessments) or compile them into one csv file inside the platform beforehand before importing them altogether into a statistical programme for further (segmented) analysis. The platform also provides a file for download with the codes/keys/names of each question/item – this is needed for further analysis as the csv file data download only provides the raw data where variables are called q1, q2,q1, … .",
      "12": "Standardized scores (z standard score) are calculated to let you know how the group of your self-assessment(s) has performed in relation to all other participants (students or employees) on the platform. We update the according reference values 1-2 times per year. Only when comparing to others you can tell whether a competence performance of your group is weak or strong. That is why we decided to show users standardized score. However, the raw data of each assessment can be downloaded in the Competence Monitor part of the platform. This option allows you to run your own statistical analysis. To do so, please always combine the raw data with the information of the file that contains the codes/keys/names of each question/ items ( downloadable next to csv file)."
